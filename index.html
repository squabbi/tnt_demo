Firstly, it comes from Matthew 25:14-30 which is the well-known Parable of the Talents. This parable is the final of three significant parables which speak of the Christian's preparedness for Jesus' return. The emphasis of the Parable of the Talents is the call to be productive. Even more specifically, it is a call for Christians to steward everything that God has entrusted to us.</p> <p>The second important Bible passage that shapes our ethos is Matthew 6:21 which states that "for where your treasure is, there your heart is also". This verse communicates the simple truth that our investments reveal the true convictions and commitments of our hearts. Within the context of Matthew 6, Christians are exhorted to be productive and prepared for eternity. This is a call to earthly sacrifice for eternal gain. </p> <p>It is these twin principles of sensible stewardship and strategic sacrifice that govern Talents and Treasures Financial Group. Our desire is that your earthly treasures will be stewarded and invested well as you keep your ultimate hope on eternity. We are dedicated to helping you express these key biblical principles.</p> <p> As a result, what we do is simple. We provide a full suite of financial services that will help you steward your income, tax, superannuation and investments. Our team will help you design a tailor fitted plan to achieve your financial aspirations. However, this is only the first part of what we do. </p> <p> The second and significant part of our work is using a portion of our profits to invest in meaningful and purposeful Christian ministries. For example, these include the work of training, equipping, and sustaining Gospel ministers in Australia and beyond. Our hope is that this will minimise the financial barriers for the next generation of godly men and women who want to step out in faith to serve our world by sharing the Gospel. Moreover, these will also include other agencies like hospitals, foreign aid, and welfare for local communities. This is part of the principle of strategic sacrifice. We do not just want to help you do it. <em><b>We want to model strategic and sacrificial stewardship too.</b></em> </p> </div> <div class="row"> <h1 class="fw-bold my-4 text-center" id="giving">Our Giving Goal</h1> <p> A survey of theological colleges across Australia shows that student enrolments are decreasing. While there are a number of factors to this decline, one of the key contributors is the financial cost of theological education. Therefore, we aim to gift our proceeds by the end of each financial year, and it is our hope to raise up to $10,000 during 2022-2023 to distribute to theological education. Many theological colleges have set up scholarship funds in an attempt to help students overcome the rising cost of theological education, and we long to come alongside these faithful institutions to play our part.</p> <p>We are also hoping to raise an additional $10,000 during the same time period to give to the care industry. Would you join us in reaching this goal?</p> </div>  <div class="row"> <h1 id="about" class="fw-bold my-4 text-center">About Us</h1> <h3 class="fw-3">Chion Tang, Founder and Director</h3> <p> Chion is the Founder and Director of Talents and Treasures Financial Group.
